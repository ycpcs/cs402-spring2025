General Course Description
------------------

This course is a continuation of Capstone Design I and is an elective for CS majors. Student design teams will continue with projects considered large enough to warrant two full semesters of project activities. The design team, with the guidance of a faculty advisor, must plan, direct, conduct, and effectively communicate the results of the design effort through a professional technical report and oral presentation. The design project will include material within and beyond the curriculum as well as technical and non-technical considerations. Design projects often result in a deliverable prototype.

Prerequisites
-------------

CS 400 - Capstone Design I with a 2.0 or better.

Textbook
--------

No textbook required.

Course Structure and Expectations
---------------------------------

For this semester (Spring 2025), this portion of CS 402 will concentrate exclusively on the further development of the projects from CS400.

Each student should maintain a *brief* weekly journal describing their work along with any reference materials to document progress throughout the semester. Each team will give an informal weekly status update on the day specified above with the remaining class periods allocated for team workdays. Additionally, there will be three Milestones throughout the semester.

Finally, each group will be required to create a poster and/or demo for the Engineering and CS Capstone Expo which will occur towards the end of the semester.

Policies
--------

### Grades

Your overall grade for the course will be determined as follows:

- The project grade is a weighted average of the milestone presentations and final report:

    - Milestone 1:      25%
    - Milestone 2:      25%
    - Milestone 3:      25%
	- Technical Report: 15% (Rough Draft: 15%, Final: 5%)
	- Team Poster:      10%
	
- Your individual grade for the course is your project grade multiplied by an individual effort factor determined by your weekly journal and mid-semester and final peer evaluations by your team members, combined with the instructors' input.

Grades are assigned on a 100-point scale:

> | Numeric Range | Letter Grade |
> |---------------|--------------|
> | 90-100        | A (4.0)      |
> | 87-90         | B+ (3.5)     |
> | 80-87         | B (3.0)      |
> | 77-80         | C+ (2.5)     |
> | 70-77         | C (2.0)      |
> | 60-70         | D (1.0)      |
> | 0-60          | F (0.0)      |

### Course website

Please check the [course web page](http://ycpcs.github.io/cs402-spring2025) regularly for important announcements.

### Exams

There are no exams for this course.

### Project

The overall grade for the course will be determined by the progress made on the chosen project through a series of milestones. Each group will be expected to demonstrate a working **system** for each milestone and discuss the progress made from the previous one. It is very important to make continuous incremental progress throughout the semester on a weekly basis.

### Attendance Policy

**Attendance at every weekly meeting is mandatory**.  If you must miss a meeting, for whatever reason, you must inform your team and the instructor as soon as possible.  Note that the course meets three times a week.

One of those meetings is the weekly status meeting (or Milestone presentation).  One or more instructors, plus your clients, will be present for those meetings.

The remaining two meeting times are reserved for you to accomplish work as a team.  Attendance at all three schedule class meeting times is mandatory.

In addition, you will need to schedule team meeting times outside of the regular class times, as this is your capstone team project course, and the amount of overall effort required to achieve a successful project launch far exceeds the assigned class times.

### Professionalism

I expect you to conduct yourself as a professional in this course. Professionalism includes:

-   Respect for and courteous interaction with peers, faculty and facilities;
-   Integrity, which includes at its core honesty, responsibility and accountability for one’s own actions;
-   Sensitivity and appreciation for diverse cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences;
-   Constructive evaluation, which means that criticism is offered and accepted in a productive manner;
-   Self-reflection and identification of one’s own strengths and weaknesses;
-   Responsibility for one’s own education and learning;
-   An attitude that fosters professional behavior in colleagues and peers;
-   Punctuality at meetings and class sessions;
-   Attentive behavior during class sessions, avoiding personal or social use of cell phones, laptops, or other electronic devices;
-   Acknowledgement of the Kinsley Engineering Center as a professional workplace, and treatment of this facility as a business or office space, not as an informal space.

I reserve the right to enforce this code through the York College Code of Student Conduct.

### Academic Integrity Policy (Philosophy Statement)

For the full policy, go the the Academic Standards section of the current Course Catalog [https://www.ycp.edu/about-us/offices-and-departments/registrar/catalogs/](https://www.ycp.edu/about-us/offices-and-departments/registrar/catalogs/).

York College of Pennsylvania, as an institution of higher education, serves to promote and sustain the creation, acquisition, and dissemination of knowledge.  In order to fulfill this purpose, an environment of integrity, dependability and honesty must be maintained by all members of the York College community.  Without a foundation based on intellectual honesty and integrity, the very ability to uphold the academic endeavors that York College strives to pursue is inhibited.
  
Academic integrity involves two fundamental expectations:

-   Anything you turn in as your own work is, in fact, your own work and your own words, completed without assistance, unless your instructor has given explicit permission otherwise.
-   Anything you turn in is truthful.  Lab data were generated in the lab (and not made up), hours worked for an internship or coop were actually worked, etc.

YCP’s academic integrity policy includes a non-exhaustive list of activities that are prohibited.  Some of the commonly encountered prohibited activities include:

-   Plagiarism (passing someone else’s words or ideas off as one’s own without proper attribution).
-   Getting assistance from other students on non-collaborative assignments.  You are permitted (and encouraged) to get assistance from your instructor and the Academic Success Center.
-   Sharing papers, exams, homework assignments, etc. with other students (even if it wasn’t your intent to cheat).
-   Ghostwriting (getting someone else to write a paper/assignment, whether it is a friend, an essay mill, or a generative AI tool).
-   Using unauthorized assistance on exams (e.g., cheat sheets, websites, publisher test banks, other students).
-   Buying/sourcing assignment answers from other people (whether it is other students, a website like Chegg, or other online sources).
-   Turning in papers/assignments completed in other classes.  

This is not a complete list of prohibited activities.  Check out the policy in the catalog for a more comprehensive list.  The onus is on you, the student, to verify that any exceptions are allowed in this class by your instructor.

Instructors have full discretion to assign a sanction up to and including a grade of 0 in the class for violations of the policy.  Violations will be reported to the Associate Provost of Student Success as outlined in the policy.  You cannot withdraw from a class if you have been charged with an academic integrity violation.
  
If at any point you are unsure whether something is allowed under the academic integrity policy, please ask your instructor!

### Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDA’s, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

### Student Accessibility Services

In accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, York College and its faculty are obliged to make reasonable classroom and physical accommodations for students with disabilities.  If you are a student with a disability in need of classroom accommodations and have not already registered with Student Accessibility Services, please see the [SAS webpage](https://www.ycp.edu/about-us/offices-and-departments/student-success/student-accessibility-services/) for more information and to complete the online form to apply for accommodations. You may also contact <sas@ycp.edu> to establish the accommodations for which you are eligible.

There is a possibility that during this course, classroom lectures may be recorded in accordance with York College of Pennsylvania policies for Student Accessibility Services.
